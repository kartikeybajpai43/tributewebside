          <h1>Prime Minister of India</h1>
          <div>
            <p>
              <b>Atal Bihari Vajpayee</b> was an Indian politician who served
              twice as Prime Minister of India, first from 16 May to 1 June
              1996, and then from 19 March 1998 to 22 May 2004. A member of the
              Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Vajpayee was the tenth Prime
              Minister. He headed the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance in
              the Indian Parliament, and became the first Prime Minister
              unaffiliated with the Indian National Congress to complete a full
              five-year term in office. He died at the age of 93 on Thursday 16
              August 2018 at 17:05 at AIIMS, New Delhi. Formation of government
              After the 1996 general election, the BJP emerged as the single
              largest party in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of Parliament.
              Vajpayee was invited by President Shankar Dayal Sharma to form a
              government, but after 13 days in office, proved unable to muster a
              governing majority and resigned. He was succeeded by H. D. Dewe
              Gowda, leader of the United Front (UF) coalition, and became the
              Leader of the Opposition. The United Front was only able to
              sustain a majority in Parliament until 1998, resigning after the
              Indian National Congress withdrew its support. In the 1998 Indian
              general election the BJP again emerged as the single-largest
              party, but was able to assemble a governing coalition called the
              National Democratic Alliance (NDA). Other constituents of the NDA
              included the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK),
              Bahujan Samaj Party, Shiv Sena, Shiromani Akali Dal, National
              Conference (NC) and the Trinamool Congress (TC), amongst others.
              By early 1999, the NDA government lost its majority after the
              AIADMK withdrew its support.[1] President K. R. Narayanan
              dissolved the Parliament and called fresh elections – the third in
              two years. Public anger against smaller parties that jeopardised
              the NDA coalition and the wave of support for the Vajpayee
              government in the aftermath of the Kargil War gave the BJP a
              larger presence in the Lok Sabha. The NDA won a decisive majority
              with the support of new constituents such as the Janata Dal
              (United) and the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam.

              The Vajpayee government expanded the process of economic
              liberalisation initiated by the P.V. Narasimha Rao government
              (1991–1996)
            </li>

              His government initiated the privatisation of most state
              corporations, including the Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd.
            </li>
            <li>
              His government also began the establishment of special export
              processing zones, Information Technology and Industrial Parks
              across the country to bolster industrial production and exports.

              In 2003, the government launched the Pravasi Bharatiya Samman
              (Honouring of Non-Resident Indians) and initiated plans to
              establish an Overseas citizenship of India to enable NRIs to
              invest and do business freely in India. His government also
              expanded efforts to encourage foreign investment, especially from
              Europe and the United States.
